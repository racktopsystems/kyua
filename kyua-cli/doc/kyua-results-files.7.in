.Nm results-files
.Nd Description of the results files naming scheme
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Results files contain, as their name implies, the results of the execution of a
test suite.  Each test suite executed by
.Xr kyua-test 1
generates a new results file, and such results files can be loaded later on by
inspection commands such as
.Xr kyua-report 1
to analyze their contents.
.Pp
All Kyua commands that create or operate on results files accept a
.Fl -store
flag to specify the location of the results file to create or open.
When this flag holds its default value,
.Sq LATEST ,
Kyua will automatically determine the name of the results file as described in
.Sx Naming scheme
below.  Otherwise, Kyua will use the provided file.
.Ss Naming scheme
Results files are stored, by default, under
.Pa ~/.kyua/actions/ .
.Pp
The name of each results file follows this pattern:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kyua.\*(Lttest_suite\*(Gt.\*(LtYYMMDD\*(Gt.\*(LtHHMMSS\*(Gt.db
.Ed
.Pp
In this scheme,
.Sq test_suite
is automatically determined from the directory where the test suite is rooted
at and
.Sq YYMMDD.HHMMSS
is assigned based on the current time.
.Ss Internals
Results files are simple SQLite databases with the schema described in the
.Pa __STOREDIR__/schema_v?.sql
files.  For details on the schema, please refer to the heavily commented SQL
file.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Pa ~/.kyua/actions/
Default location for the results files.
.It Pa __STOREDIR__/schema_v?.sql
SQL schema to apply to new results files.
