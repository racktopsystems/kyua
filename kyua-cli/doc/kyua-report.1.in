.Sh NAME
.Nm report
.Nd Generates reports with the results of a test action
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -output Ar path
.Op Fl -results-filter Ar types
.Op Fl -show-context
.Op Fl -store Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command generates a user-friendly, plain-text report designed to be
consumed by the user from the terminal.  This report is not intended to be
machine-parseable.  To do so, the command processes an action file and then
creates a textual summary of the test case results
recorded in that action.
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -output Ar path
Specifies the path to which the report should be written to.  The special values
.Pa /dev/stdout
and
.Pa /dev/stderr
can be used to specify the standard output and the standard error
respectively.
.It Fl -results-filter Ar types
Comma-separated list of the test result types to include in the report.
The ordering of the values is respected so that you can determine how you
want the list of tests to be shown.
.Pp
The valid values are:
.Sq broken ,
.Sq failed ,
.Sq passed ,
.Sq skipped
and
.Sq xfail .
If the parameter supplied to the option is empty, filtering is suppressed
and all result types are shown in the report.
.Pp
The default value for this flag includes all the test results except the
passed tests.  Showing the passed tests by default clutters the report with
too much information, so only abnormal conditions are included.
.It Fl -show-context
Prints the runtime context of the action.
.It Fl -store Ar path , Fl s Ar path
Specifies the action file to operate on.  Defaults to
.Sq LATEST ,
which causes
.Nm
to automatically load the latest action file for the current test suite.
See
.Xr kyua-action-files 7
for more information.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command always returns 0.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
